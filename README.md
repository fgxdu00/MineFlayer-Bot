# MINEFLAYER BOT

Simple bot that can do nearly everything you want

## About

It's a JavaScript bot I put together from various pieces of code from various sources that can do almost anything you need it to do. The function you need can be programmed for later use. It is based on the [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/blob/master/docs/README.md) library. Documentation on how to use its functions [here](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/blob/master/docs/api.md).

## How to use

Run command line in the folder with the downloaded files and type `npm install` to install all dependencies. This command is written once and is not used further. Make sure you have NodeJS installed.
Next, in the same command line, type `node main.js`. This will launch the file if there are no problems with installing dependencies
