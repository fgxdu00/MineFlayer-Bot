# MINEFLAYER BOT


Simple bot that can do nearly everything you want


## About


It's a JavaScript bot I put together from various pieces of code from various sources that can do almost anything you need it to do. The function you need can be programmed for later use. It is based on the [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/blob/master/docs/README.md) library. Documentation on how to use its functions [here](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/blob/master/docs/api.md).


## Installation

 1. Download the package
 2. Download & install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v20.10.0)
 3. Download & install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.12.1)
 4. Run `setup.bat` in folder
 
 ## Usage
 
 1. Configure bot in `settings.json` file
 2. Start bot with `start.bat`


## Shortcomings


On servers where player nicknames come after the name of the clan, prefix, separated by some symbols, and similar, may not work recognizing nickname because of what will not respond to player commands. On local servers or servers without plugins for chat all works stably (tested)
